## Usage

## Requirements

## Installation
### Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the `swift` compiler. It is in early development, but `flex-ui` does support its use on supported platforms.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding `flex-ui` as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/space-code/flex-ui.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.0.0"))
]
```

## Communication
- If you **found a bug**, open an issue.

- If you **want to contribute**, submit a pull request.
